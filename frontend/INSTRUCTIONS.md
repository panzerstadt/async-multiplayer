# Frontend Development Plan

This document outlines the plan for developing the frontend of the Async Multiplayer Management System.

## 1. Component Library Setup (ShadCN)

- **Initialize ShadCN:** Use the ShadCN CLI to set up the component library.
- **Choose Style and Color:** Select a style (e.g., `Default` or `New York`) and a base color (e.g., `Slate`, `Gray`, `Zinc`, `Neutral`, `Stone`).

## 2. UI Pages

- **Create Game Page (`/create-game`):** A page with a form for creating a new game.
- **Join Game Page (`/join-game`):** A page with a form for joining an existing game.
- **Dashboard Page (`/dashboard`):** A page to display and manage ongoing games.

## 3. Form Handling

- **Install Dependencies:** Add `react-hook-form` and `zod` for form handling and validation.
- **Implement Forms:** Create forms for creating and joining games, with validation rules for user inputs.

## 4. API Integration

- **Service Layer:** Create a dedicated service layer to handle all API calls to the backend.
- **Environment Variables:** Use environment variables to manage the backend API URL.
- **API Calls:** Implement API calls for:
    - Creating a new game.
    - Joining an existing game.
    - Fetching game details.
    - Uploading and downloading save files.

## 5. Notifications

- **Install Dependency:** Add a notification library like `sonner`.
- **Implement Notifications:** Set up a system to display notifications for events like:
    - Successful game creation/joining.
    - Turn reminders.
    - Errors.
