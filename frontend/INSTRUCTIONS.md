# Frontend Development Plan

This document outlines the plan for developing the frontend of the Async Multiplayer Management System.

## Completed Tasks

- **Component Library Setup (ShadCN):** Initialized ShadCN with the `New York` style and `Zinc` base color.
- **UI Pages:** Created basic pages for `Create Game` (`/create-game`), `Join Game` (`/join-game`), and `Dashboard` (`/dashboard`).
- **Form Handling:** Implemented form handling using `react-hook-form` and `zod` for validation in `Create Game` and `Join Game` pages.
- **API Integration:** Integrated `axios` for API calls and `TanStack Query` (`react-query`) for state management. The API service now includes an interceptor for authentication tokens.
- **Notifications:** Set up `sonner` for displaying toast notifications.
- **Authentication:** Implemented Google OAuth2 login/logout flow with a basic `AuthContext` and `withAuth` Higher-Order Component for route protection.
- **Dashboard Enhancements:** Integrated `GameCard` component to display game details, including player information, and added basic save file upload/download functionality.

## Next Steps

1.  **Manual Frontend Testing:** Thoroughly test all implemented frontend features to ensure they function correctly and as expected.
2.  **UI/UX Refinement:** Improve the overall visual design, responsiveness, and user experience of the application.
3.  **Enhanced Error Handling and Loading States:** Implement more comprehensive error handling mechanisms and user-friendly loading indicators across all pages and components.
4.  **Real-time Notifications:** Develop a real-time notification system (e.g., using WebSockets) to provide instant updates for events like turn changes.
