- **Real-time Notifications:** Develop a real-time notification system (e.g., using WebSockets) to provide instant updates for events like turn changes.
- **Internationalization (i18n):** Add support for multiple languages.
- **Accessibility (a11y):** Ensure the application is fully accessible to users with disabilities.
- **End-to-end Testing:** Implement an end-to-end testing suite using a framework like Cypress or Playwright.
